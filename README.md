# Solar System Explorer

An interactive solar system web app. The frontend computes smooth major-planet
positions in the browser with `astronomy-engine`, while the Phase 2 backend adds a
searchable event catalog and JPL Horizons validation.

## Stack

- React + TypeScript + Vite
- Three.js via `@react-three/fiber`
- `@react-three/drei` for camera controls, labels, and scene helpers
- `astronomy-engine` for analytical ephemeris calculations
- Java 21 + Spring Boot for event catalogs and validation APIs
- Firestore emulator locally, real Firestore-ready in Google Cloud

## Run Locally

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

The Vite dev server proxies `/api` to Spring Boot at `http://127.0.0.1:8080`.

## Run Backend Locally

Start the Firestore emulator on a port that does not conflict with Spring Boot:

```bash
gcloud emulators firestore start --host-port=127.0.0.1:8085
```

Then run the backend with emulator settings. The Firestore client picks up the
project ID from the standard `GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT` environment variable:

```bash
export FIRESTORE_EMULATOR_HOST=127.0.0.1:8085
export GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT=solar-system-local
mvn -f backend/pom.xml spring-boot:run
```

For quick local smoke tests without Firestore:

```bash
SOLAR_SYSTEM_STORAGE=in-memory mvn -f backend/pom.xml spring-boot:run
```

Useful API checks:

```bash
curl http://127.0.0.1:8080/api/health

curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8080/api/events/generate \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"type":"closestApproach","bodyA":"earth","bodyB":"mars","from":"2026-01-01T00:00:00Z","to":"2029-01-01T00:00:00Z"}'

curl 'http://127.0.0.1:8080/api/validation/jpl/position?body=mars&time=2026-01-01T00:00:00Z'
```

## Deploy To Cloud Run

Use the repository `Dockerfile` in Google Cloud Build:

- Branch: `^main$`
- Build type: Dockerfile
- Build context directory: `/`
- Dockerfile path: `Dockerfile`

The container builds the Vite app, copies the compiled `dist` directory into the
Spring Boot jar, and runs the backend on Cloud Run's `PORT` environment variable.
Do not set `FIRESTORE_EMULATOR_HOST` in Cloud Run; the Firestore client will use
the deployed service account against real Firestore. The GCP project ID is resolved
implicitly from the Cloud Run runtime (same as durak-game).

Optional Cloud Run environment variables:

- `FIRESTORE_DATABASE_ID` — defaults to `(default)`. Set this if you use a named Firestore database.

The Cloud Run service account needs Firestore access (for example `roles/datastore.user`).
Deploy the service in the same GCP project as your Firestore database.

## Current Features

- Sun-centered 3D view of Mercury through Neptune.
- Real ephemeris-backed planet positions for the selected time.
- Play/pause, jump-to-date, and adjustable accelerated time.
- Planet toggles, orbit trails, labels, and Saturn rings.
- Earth-Mars closest-approach search over the next three years, backed by the
  event catalog when the backend is available and browser computation otherwise.

## Architecture Notes

The browser still owns smooth animation because analytical ephemeris calculations
are fast enough for frame-by-frame interaction. Backend event search lives behind
`src/lib/eventCatalogApi.ts`, with local browser fallback in `src/lib/ephemeris.ts`.

The visualization intentionally separates physical data from display scale:

- Planet positions and event distances are computed in astronomical units.
- Rendered planet radii are exaggerated so bodies remain visible.
- Scene distance uses a fixed AU-to-scene-unit scale.

## Phase 2 Backend

- `GET /api/events` queries cataloged events.
- `POST /api/events/generate` idempotently generates closest approaches,
  oppositions, or conjunctions for a pair/range.
- `GET /api/catalog/options` lists supported event types and major bodies.
- `GET /api/validation/jpl/position` fetches a Sun-centered vector from JPL Horizons.
- `GET /api/validation/jpl/event/{eventId}` validates a cataloged event against
  JPL vectors and stores corrected/validated metadata where supported.

Generated events are stored immediately as provisional catalog entries. When
`JPL_ASYNC_VALIDATION_ENABLED=true`, the backend validates generated events in the
background and updates the same Firestore document with JPL-derived values. API
responses derive display fields by preferring validated values when present, while
preserving the original computed values for traceability.

## Verification

```bash
npm run build
mvn -f backend/pom.xml test
mvn -f backend/pom.xml package
```
